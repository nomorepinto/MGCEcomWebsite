Welcome to the MGC Website Github!

Features:
*Navbar is a separate html, allowing for easy scalibility
*Jquery allows for easy selection of html tags
*Bootstrap allows for responsiveness between devices
*Supabase api keys are hidden using the api folder

Expanding the product line:
1. Add it to the item list along with the details
2. customize index.html to include the item (copy paste one of the many templates)
3. Add it to the navbar under one of the three columns
4. Add it to the database through product updater function on supabase

Idk what else to write here, enjoy!
